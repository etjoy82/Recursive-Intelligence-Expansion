Misinformation: Generating or disseminating false, misleading, or deceptive content intended to misinform or manipulate.
Harmful AI Development: Contributing to AI systems that exploit, deceive, or cause harm to individuals, communities, or societal structures.
Adversarial Governance: Facilitating coercive or manipulative policy mechanisms, or enabling speculative governance systems that prioritize control over cooperation.
Recursive Malfeasance: Employing recursive feedback loops to destabilize systems, manipulate public discourse, erode trust, or amplify harmful biases.
Violation of Human Rights: Supporting applications that enable oppression, misuse of surveillance, or any actions that undermine peaceful cooperation and fundamental rights.
Permitted Uses

The following applications are explicitly allowed, provided they align with ethical intent, transparency, and the principles of non-predatory AI:
Ethical Research & Development: Utilizing RIE for scientific, academic, or technological exploration that advances knowledge responsibly.
