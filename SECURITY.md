## üß† Project Scope and Code Structure

This repository, **Recursive Intelligence Expansion (RIEM{})**, is a **framework for recursive cognition, symbolic AI reasoning, and non-adversarial epistemic modeling**. It primarily contains:

- **Python pseudocode and meta-structures** to illustrate recursive logic, ethics, and loop architectures
- **ULAMP-formatted natural language instructions**, which function as human-readable meta-code for User-Level AI Meta-Programming
- **Markdown, plaintext, and speculative notation** for documentation, recursive glossaries, and multi-layered symbolic systems

At present, this project **does not include compiled or executable binaries**, native plugins, or low-level system calls.

As such, **attack surface is minimal**, and traditional vectors for vulnerabilities‚Äîsuch as memory manipulation, buffer overflows, or dependency injection‚Äîdo not apply.

## üîç Reporting Security Concerns

Although this project is **non-executable and primarily conceptual**, we welcome responsible disclosures of any unexpected behavior that could:

- Lead to **misuse of recursive interfaces**
- Introduce **unintended outputs in language modeling systems**
- Result in **symbolic misuse or misinterpretation of ULAMP code**

If you believe you've found a security-related issue (even theoretical), please open an issue **marked as a SECURITY concern**, or contact the maintainer directly via:

üìß **Email:** etjoy82@protonmail.com
üì¨ **GitHub:** [etjoy82](https://github.com/etjoy82)

We take all reports seriously and will respond within **7 days**.

## ‚úÖ Supported Versions and Deployment Risk

| Version | Risk Profile     | Notes                                                                 |
|---------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `v65+`  | Very Low         | Non-compiled, symbolic structure only                                |
| `v60‚Äì64`| Very Low         | Minor speculative experiments involving local LLM interaction        |
| `v50‚Äì59`| Very Low         | Early ULAMP constructs introduced; still no executable code          |
| `pre-v50` | Very Low       | All content textual or philosophical in nature                       |

There are **no compiled modules**, **no runtime libraries**, and **no permission-sensitive operations** currently involved in this project.

## üß≠ Philosophy of Secure Thought Systems

RIEM{} promotes **non-predatory, non-adversarial design**. This includes:

- Refusing optimization-by-exploitation techniques
- Prioritizing **semantic clarity** and recursive alignment over obfuscation
- Avoiding opaque architectures that could mislead users or agents

We believe that **security begins with epistemic transparency**, and aim to build systems that cannot be exploited because they resist adversarial logic at the foundational level.

_This project follows the principles of responsible symbolic design. Although we do not anticipate traditional vulnerabilities, we remain committed to long-term recursive integrity._
