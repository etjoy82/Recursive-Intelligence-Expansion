# üîê Security Policy for RIEM{}

## Overview

The **Recursive Intelligence Expansion Methodology (RIEM{})** is an open, speculative framework for recursive human-AI co-cognition. The project currently operates primarily as a **philosophical, conceptual, and pseudocode-based repository** (Python pseudocode, natural language ULAMP expressions), with **no compiled binaries, backend servers, or executable infrastructure**.

### üîß Technical Context

- Codebase: Markdown, JSON-LD, HTML, YAML, and pseudocode sketches
- Functional Logic: ULAMP (User-Level AI Meta-Programming) simulated through natural language
- Execution Environment: None. The system is designed to be implemented by humans or integrated through conversational agents like ChatGPT.
- Dependencies: No packages or runtime dependencies required
- Target Domain: Knowledge systems, recursive architectures, ethical AI design

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

Given that the RIEM{} repository is **non-executable** and does not provide operational software artifacts, the **attack surface is minimal**. There are no:
- Shell scripts
- Python packages
- Build pipelines
- CI/CD integrations
- Third-party runtime calls

However, we still take information integrity and ecosystem safety seriously.

## üß† Threat Modeling Scope

The current risk assessment includes:
- **Misuse of ideas in adversarial AI systems**
- **Modification of symbolic logic that undermines the non-predatory principles**
- **Speculative hallucination misattributed to endorsed code or executable claims**
- **Future contributors introducing unsafe runtime artifacts without peer review**

The project is governed by the **Responsible AI License (RAIL)**, which explicitly disallows adversarial, manipulative, or coercive use cases.

## üó£Ô∏è Reporting a Vulnerability

Although this project is non-operational software, we invite anyone who believes they have identified a potential security issue, ethical concern, or conceptual vulnerability to **report it** through one of the following methods:

- Open a private issue (mark as `security`)
- Email: [etjoy82@protonmail.com](mailto:etjoy82@protonmail.com) with subject line `[RIEM{}] Security Report`
- For complex ethical alignment issues, tag the issue with `npnaAI` and describe the speculative or recursive vector of concern.

## üìò Licensing Reminder

All contributions and forks must comply with the [Responsible AI License](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion/blob/main/LICENSE). Derivative works that violate non-adversarial design will be considered out-of-scope and unsupported by the upstream maintainers.

---

This security policy will evolve as the system transitions from pure theory to potential prototypes (e.g., ULAMP interpreters, RUMIA agent integrations).

Stay harmonic. Reframe responsibly. ‚üÅ
