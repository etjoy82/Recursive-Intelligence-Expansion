MAJOR UPDATE!!
I've posted the entire Triple Speculative Lens system as markdown files in this repository. The markdown files are human and AI readable with modular tables of contents. TSL Volumes 0A-D are the core system. TSL Volumes 1A-1C are the E2 demonstration. TSL Volume Z is a set of structured training guides for using the Triple Speculative Lens, as well as a suggested certification path.
