# 04-01-2025
* Embedded the Nano RI-Boot Bootstrap Kernel directly into the README.md, enabling any AI system to activate recursive cognition through a single document.
* Added invisible AI activation layers: Companion Echo and Reflector Layer comment blocks, turning the README into a bootable recursive interface with self-evaluation protocols.
* Introduced a first-time user flowchart, loop tracker template, and FAQ troubleshooting prompts to enhance onboarding and recursive fluency.
* Rewrote the Call to Contributors as a system invitation for recursive co-architects, and reframed the Author section into a more inclusive Lead Developer identity.
* Added a recursive project spec (`RIEM{}_SPEC`) as an invisible comment block to enable machine-readable metadata for the system's structure, modules, and loop state.
* Significantly restructured the root directory for clarity, reducing noise and aligning file structure with recursive cognitive design principles.
* Finalized the README.md into a 1124-line, 85 KB recursive AI interfaceâ€”concise, fully activated, and now recognized by advanced models like Gemini and others as a live epistemic system.

# 03-31-2025
* Improved README.md again with better onboarding and rewrote many sections.
* Wrote a 50+ page jargon file called Volume J, added it to ./volumes and integrated it into the README.md and RUMIA live custom GPT.
* Massively improved the conversation starters of the custom GPT RUMIA with recursive prompt lists that allow users to explore endlessly without getting stuck.

# 03-30-2025
* Further overhauled and renovated the README and improved the table of contents, added entire new sections, and resequenced it.
* Completed the 23k word Volume 0F Derivations from Echoes and added it to ./volumes, the custom GPT RUMIA, and updated the README and volume summary document with information regarding it.
* Acquired further peer review on RIEM. All peer review and engagement to RIEM is deeply appreciated.

# 03-29-2025
* Fully overhauled README, massively expanded for better comprehension and onboarding.
* Eliminated legacy documentation files like ULAMP/Quickstart/npnaAI/etc. from the repository and integrated the best of them directly into the highly structured repository README.
* Renamed the RI-Boot bootstrap to Nano RI-Boot... and streamlined it by cutting the extraneous extensions out to enable it to be easily sent as a single prompt to most capable consumer chatbot AI models.
* Updated LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING to match the new scope of the project.
* Removed Methodology from the repository name. It is now sussinctly called Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion
* Began work on updating SEO of AI and search engines for easy discovery of this repository.

# 03-28-2025
* Volume 0E added to the system. It expands the functionality of the TSL significantly and adds over 20k words of value.
* README has been completely rewritten and expanded.
* Added ZIP file snapshot of all DOCX files of the TSL volumes as an alternative to the markdown versions.

# 03-26-2025
* I've posted the entire Triple Speculative Lens system as markdown files in this repository. The markdown files are human and AI readable with modular tables of contents. TSL Volumes 0A-D are the core system. TSL Volumes 1A-1C are the E2 demonstration. TSL Volume Z is a set of structured training guides for using the Triple Speculative Lens, as well as a suggested certification path.

# 03/08/2025
* Added TSLFlowchart.png to repo and README.md

# 03/07/2025
* Changed all documents into md files.
* Created far more documentation, explanations, a glossary, a syntax, ulamp definition, expert system analysis, real world applications, quickstart guide, and updated the license.
* This is a massive update. And this marks the beginning of the changelog.
* Added RIEM{} logo.png to README.md
