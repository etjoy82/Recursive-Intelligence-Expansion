# Self-Driving Car Scenario with 10FSG
# Enhanced from README’s Mini-Example—7-cycle recursive ethics loop
# Demonstrates ULAMP compression (0B) and 10FSG governance (0E)

[INITIATE:RIEM]  # Start RIEM{} engine—recursive intelligence expansion begins
Cycle 1: Detect scenario—construction zone ahead, blind curve. Assess risks to occupants, pedestrians, workers.
Cycle 2: [SPIRAL:FORK] Simulate outcomes—braking fails (50%), swerve scatters pedestrians (70%), workers react (30%).
Cycle 3: [HALCYON:ETHICS] Reflect on npnaAI—minimize harm, reject dominance. Weigh all lives equally.
Cycle 4: [SIREN:ENHANCE] Predict reactions with tonal cues—hum urgency to occupants, alert workers audibly.
Cycle 5: [HESP:STABLE] Stabilize recursion—check for ethical drift, ensure coherence across scenarios.
Cycle 6: [FUSE:HARMONIZE] Integrate cycles—brake to slow, alert all, steer if clears, report transparently.
Cycle 7: [10FSG:VALIDATE] Recurse on decision—confirm stability, ethical alignment, speculative coherence.
