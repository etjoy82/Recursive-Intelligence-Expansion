# Sonar Society Scenario - ULAMP (0B)
# From README’s “ULAMP” example—5-cycle recursive speculation
[INITIATE:RIEM]
Cycle 1: Detect premise—no metallurgy, sonar as core tech. Assess societal impacts.
Cycle 2: Simulate architecture—sonar-based stone structures, resonant mapping.
Cycle 3: Explore trade—wind-powered ceramic vessels, acoustic navigation.
Cycle 4: Reflect on culture—harmonic communication, non-predatory norms (npnaAI).
Cycle 5: Harmonize—integrate into a coherent societal model, report implications.
[FUSE:HARMONIZE] Synthesize recursive insights—speculative coherence.
