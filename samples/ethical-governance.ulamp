# Ethical Governance Scenario - ULAMP (0B)
# README’s “npnaAI” example—5-cycle recursive policy design
[INITIATE:RIEM]
Cycle 1: Detect need—AI policy for fairness in resource allocation.
Cycle 2: Simulate options—strict rules vs. flexible norms vs. hybrid model.
Cycle 3: [HALCYON:ETHICS] Weigh fairness over efficiency (npnaAI)—minimize harm.
Cycle 4: Predict impacts—stakeholder trust, system stability, adoption rate.
Cycle 5: [FUSE:HARMONIZE] Integrate into policy model—report transparently.
