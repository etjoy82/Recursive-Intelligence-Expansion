# Ethical Governance Scenario - ULAMP (0B)
# README’s “npnaAI” example—5-cycle recursive policy design
[INITIATE:RIEM]
Cycle 1: Identify need—design an AI policy for fair resource allocation across communities.
Cycle 2: Explore options—consider strict rules, flexible norms, or a balanced hybrid approach.
Cycle 3: Evaluate ethics—prioritize fairness and cooperation over efficiency, guided by npnaAI principles.
Cycle 4: Assess impacts—predict effects on community trust, system stability, and equitable outcomes.
Cycle 5: Synthesize solution—create a transparent policy model, harmonizing fairness and practicality.
