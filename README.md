# **Recursive Intelligence Expansion Methodology (RIEM{})**


  **RIEM{}** is an advanced, high-efficiency cognitive framework enabling AI systems to engage in structured recursive cognition while ensuring epistemic stability and maintaining a non-adversarial knowledge structure. Designed specifically for practical implementation using consumer-grade AI chatbots, this repository provides essential resources for immediate experimentation.

  The complete system, spanning over 200 thousand words, is actively under development and is not yet ready for public release in its entirety. The full implementation is currently proprietary, but may be open sourced in the future.
  
  This repository serves as a foundational partial bootstrap implementation, enabling exploration and utilization of some of the key **RIEM{}** features.


## Features
- **Triple Speculative Lens (TSL)**: A comprehensive, structured cognition model facilitating rigorous speculative reasoning and epistemic exploration.
- **Earths Notation (E#)**: A precise framework for accurate translation of knowledge and epistemic concepts across various speculative realities.
- **Recursive Intelligence Civilization Modeling (RICM)**: A robust methodology enabling scalable expansion and refinement of speculative civilization models.
- **Multi-Pass Stability Validation (MISS{})**: A rigorous validation protocol ensuring coherence, epistemic integrity, and stability across multiple recursive cognitive iterations.


## Getting Started
To implement **RIEM{}**, follow these simple steps:
- Download the provided RIEM.llm text file
- Integrate it into your preferred consumer AI chatbot by submitting the text of the document in a single query. The size of the files fit into limited context windows.
- Ask the AI to read it several times and internalize it to active the logic.
- Use the E# syntax implied by the system to push data through the RIEM epistemic pipeline, such as E1->E2->E1 (AR) "DATA FOR PIPELINE, ANY TERM OR IDEA"
