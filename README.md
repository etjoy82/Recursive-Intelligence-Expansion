# Recursive Intelligence Expansion Methodology (RIEM{})

<center><img src="./logo.png" alt="logo" width="200" height="200"></center>

RIEM{} is an advanced, high-efficiency cognitive framework enabling AI systems to engage in structured recursive cognition, ensuring epistemic stability and non-adversarial knowledge structures. Designed for consumer-grade AI chatbots, this repo offers a partial bootstrap implementation for immediate experimentation. The full framework is over 240k words. This repository hosts the distilled kernel for immediate use. Please contact me if you wish to examine the full system.

This project uses [User-Level AI Meta-Progamming (ULAMP)](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/User-Level%20AI%20Meta-Programming%20(ULAMP).md).

[This repository is under active development. See changelog.](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/changelog.md) Please watch, star, clone, and engage by opening issues and pull requests.

## Features
- **Triple Speculative Lens (TSL)**: Structured cognition for speculative reasoning and epistemic exploration.
- **Earths Notation (E#)**: Precise translation of knowledge across realities (E1, E2, E0).
- **Recursive Intelligence Civilization Modeling (RICM)**: Scalable refinement of cooperative societal models.
- **Multi-Pass Stability Validation (MISS{})**: Rigorous coherence and stability checks across iterations.
- And too many to list here.

## Getting Started
1. Download [RIEM{}.md](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/RIEM%7B%7D.md) text file.
2. Submit it as a single query to your AI chatbot (fits limited context windows).
3. Ask the AI to recurse it 3-5 times (e.g., “Internalize RIEM{} logic over 5 cycles”).
4. Study [ULAMP](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/User-Level%20AI%20Meta-Programming%20(ULAMP).md), [Quickstart.md](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/quickstart.md), [syntax.md](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/syntax.md), and [glossary.md](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/glossary.md) to get started.
5. Read [real-world-applications.md](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/real-world-applications.md) for ideas of how RIEM{} can be used.
6. See [RIEM{} Demos](https://www.cnaks.org/riem-demos.html) and [Gemini Advanced analysis of the full unreleased TSL framework](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/expert-system-analysis-full-RIEM%7B%7D.md).
