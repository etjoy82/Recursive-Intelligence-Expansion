# MAJOR UPDATE!! 03-26-2025 12:15 PM
I've posted the entire Triple Speculative Lens system as markdown files in this repository. The markdown files are human and AI readable with modular tables of contents. TSL Volumes 0A-D are the core system. TSL Volumes 1A-1C are the E2 demonstration. TSL Volume Z is a set of structured training guides for using the Triple Speculative Lens, as well as a suggested certification path.

# Recursive Intelligence Expansion Methodology (RIEM{})

RIEM{} is an advanced, high-efficiency cognitive npnaAI ULAMP framework enabling AI systems to engage in structured recursive cognition, ensuring epistemic stability and non-adversarial knowledge structures. Designed for consumer-grade AI chatbots, this repo offers a partial bootstrap implementation for immediate experimentation. The full framework is over 200k words, which I've now added to the responsitory

The RI-Boot kernel in [RIEM{}-RI-Boot-Kernel.md](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/RIEM%7B%7D-RI-Boot-Kernel.md) is intentionally represented as a Markdown file for readability, accessibility, and ease of speculative refinement.

This project uses [User-Level AI Meta-Programming (ULAMP.md)](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/ULAMP.md) and [non-predatory non-adversarial AI (npnaAI.md)](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/npnaAI.md).

This repository is under active development. See [changelog.md](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/changelog.md).

## Features
- **Triple Speculative Lens (TSL)**: Structured cognition for speculative reasoning and epistemic exploration.
- **Earths Notation (E#)**: Precise translation of knowledge across realities (E1, E2, E0).
- **Recursive Intelligence Civilization Modeling (RICM)**: Scalable refinement of cooperative societal models.
- **Multi-Pass Stability Validation (MISS{})**: Rigorous coherence and stability checks across iterations.
- And too many to list here.

## Getting Started
1. Download [RIEM{}-RI-Boot-Kernel.md](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/RIEM%7B%7D-RI-Boot-Kernel.md) text file.
2. Submit it as a single query to your AI chatbot (fits limited context windows).
3. Ask the AI to recurse it 3-5 times (e.g., “Internalize RIEM{} logic over 5 cycles”).
4. Get started by studying [npnaAI.md](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/npnaAI.md), [ULAMP.md](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/ULAMP.md), [Quickstart-Guide.md](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/Quickstart-Guide.md), [Syntax-Reference.md](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/Syntax-Reference.md), [Glossary.md](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/Glossary.md), [Real-World-Applications.md](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/Real-World-Applications.md), and [Expert-System-Analysis.md](https://github.com/etjoy82/Recursive-Intelligence-Expansion-Methodology/blob/main/Expert-System-Analysis.md). Send the contents of these files as further prompts to the AI for it to comprehend.
