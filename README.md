# Recursive Intelligence Expansion Methodology (RIEM{})

RIEM{} is a high-efficiency framework for enabling AI systems to perform **structured recursive cognition** while maintaining **epistemic stability** and **non-adversarial knowledge structuring**. This repository contains **syntax.txt** and **bootstrap.txt** for immediate use with consumer AI chatbots.

## Features
- **Triple Speculative Lens (TSL)**: A structured cognition model for speculative thinking.
- **Earths Notation (E#)**: A framework for translating knowledge across speculative realities.
- **Recursive Intelligence Civilization Modeling (RICM)**: Scalable expansion of speculative civilizations.
- **Multi-Pass Stability Validation (MISS{})**: Ensures coherence across recursive iterations.

## Getting Started
1. Download the **bootstrap document** and **syntax.txt**.
2. Add the text of both documents to your preferred AI chatbot in a query (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude).
3. Follow the instructions in bootstrap.txt and syntax.txt to execute RIEM{}.
