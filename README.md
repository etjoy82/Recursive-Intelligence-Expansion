# Recursive Intelligence Expansion Methodology (RIEM{})

RIEM{} is a high-efficiency framework for enabling AI systems to perform **structured recursive cognition** while maintaining **epistemic stability** and **non-adversarial knowledge structuring**. This repository contains **syntax.txt** and **bootstrap.txt** for immediate use with consumer AI chatbots. The full system is tens of thousands of words long and still in active development, but not ready for the public in its current form.

## Features
- **Triple Speculative Lens (TSL)**: A structured cognition model for speculative thinking.
- **Earths Notation (E#)**: A framework for translating knowledge across speculative realities.
- **Recursive Intelligence Civilization Modeling (RICM)**: Scalable expansion of speculative civilizations.
- **Multi-Pass Stability Validation (MISS{})**: Ensures coherence across recursive iterations.

## Getting Started
1. Download **bootstrap.txt** and **syntax.txt**.
2. Add the text of both documents to your preferred AI chatbot in one or two queries (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).
3. Follow the instructions in bootstrap.txt and syntax.txt to execute RIEM{}.
